<h1>Does Inflation Eat Debt?</h1>
<p class="lead">
    There is an idea that gets repeated a lot that inflation eats debt. This is not necessarily true.
    Inflation can eat debt, but it depends on the interest rate and the rate of inflation.
</p>
<p>
    When people say “don’t overpay, inflation will eat the debt”, they really mean:
    If the real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate on your mortgage is low or negative, the debt shrinks in real
    terms over time, so keeping cheap debt can make sense.
